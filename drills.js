//QUESTIONS:

//1A.)  How many steps would a binary search take to find 8 in sorted array [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18]?
//[3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18]
//[3, 5, 6, 8]
//[6, 8]
//[8]
//4 steps required.


//1B.)  How many steps would a binary search take to find 16 in sorted array [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18]?
//Note: 16 not present in array.
//[3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18]
//[12, 14, 15, 17, 18]
//[17, 18]
//[17, 18]  Loop exited as 16 is less than 17 which is the current math.floor value.  End of function, return -1
//4 steps required.
